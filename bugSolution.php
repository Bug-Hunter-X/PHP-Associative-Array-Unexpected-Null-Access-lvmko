The solution involves consistently using the associative keys ('a', 'b', 'c' in this case) to access array elements.  Avoid assuming numerical index ordering for associative arrays.

```php
<?php
$data = array('a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3);

foreach ($data as $key => $value) {
  echo "Key: $key, Value: $value\n";
}

// Correct way to access elements:
echo "Value with key 'a': " . $data['a'] . "\n";
echo "Value with key 'b': " . $data['b'] . "\n";
echo "Value with key 'c': " . $data['c'] . "\n";
?>
```
This revised code demonstrates the correct method of accessing elements using their associated keys, eliminating the unexpected behavior.
